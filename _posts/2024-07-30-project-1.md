title: Project 1 - Quality of service

---


This project is about a report that was intended to be embedded on the company's website to provide information on quality of service, respectively, to each registered user. 

## The report

The final layout was a result of the cooperation between the team, on the layout itself, the clients on the visual that should be used, and which data should be presented, and my personal contribution on the visual formatting of the report. I've also created the data model for this report.

The report is composed by 5 pages and the colors used were the official ones, where the red is the company's main color, and the cyan is the color that the selected service. 

The interactions between the visuals where disabled allowing the users to have a clearer access to the insights. They can interact with the report by using the filters which are placed on the header and the filter pane.

### Page 1

![Page 1](/public/images/p1_1.png)

This page is composed by:

- Header: with the page title and the main filters (this layout is repeated through all pages except the Datasheet)
- Section 1: with the total and the totals per group and the correspondent donut chart (The donut chart as chosen instead the alternatives, a column chart and pie chart, because the data had 4 groups and it was more visually appealing to the established layout)
- Section 2: a gauge of the overall main KPI 
- Section 3: three heatmaps showing the main KPI per region
- Section 4: a line chart to show the trend of another KPI, using colors on the maximum and minimum values to ease the preattentive processing
- Section 5: a stacked column chart with the totals per group and the KPI per date
- Footnote: with company's logo, the timestamp of the last refresh, the dates being considered on the report and a link to the Datasheet. 

## Conclusion

This project will help me to learn Python while exploring its versatility in different areas. In the meantime, I will learn how to scrap data, how to automate scripts, how to store data to be 24/7 available and, finally, how to show the acquired data.
