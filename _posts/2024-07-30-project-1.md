title: Project 1 - Quality of Service
---

This project involved creating a report designed to be embedded on the company's website, providing quality of service information tailored to each registered user.

## The Report

The final layout was the result of collaboration among the team, who worked on the layout; the marketing department (client)
, who provided input on the visuals and data presentation; and my own contributions, which focused on visual formatting and data modeling.

The report consists of 5 pages and uses the company's official color scheme, with red as the main color and cyan representing the selected service.

Interactions between visuals were disabled to provide clearer access to insights. Users can interact with the report using filters located in the header and filter pane.

The visuals are arranged according to the [Z pattern](https://yingdesign.medium.com/be-a-designer-who-can-also-help-with-writing-copy-2f4ea02a5646).

### Page 1

Page 1 includes:

- Header: with the page title and main filters (this layout is repeated on all pages except the Datasheet);
- Section 1: displaying the grand total, totals per group, and a corresponding donut chart (though pies, and donuts, are often reserved for dessert, as [Stephen Few](https://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/save_the_pies_for_dessert.pdf) would say, this chart was chosen over a column chart to meet client requirements);
- Section 2: a gauge for the overall main KPI;
- Section 3: three heatmaps showing the main KPI by region;
- Section 4: a line chart showing the trend of another KPI, with colors highlighting maximum and minimum values to facilitate users' [preattentive processing](https://datascience.aero/brain-data-visualization/);
- Section 5: a stacked column chart with totals per group and a line representing the KPI over time;
- Footnote: featuring the company logo, the last refresh timestamp, report dates, and a link to the Datasheet.

### Page 2

Page 2 also includes 5 sections:

- Section 1: similar to Page 1, displaying totals per subgroup with a corresponding donut chart;
- Section 2: showing a total for a variable and a table with percentages and totals, using a color gradient to highlight higher values;
- Section 3: a table divided into two parts to show percentages and totals for each value;
- Section 4: a line chart showing the trend of another KPI with colors highlighting maximum and minimum values;
- Section 5: another line chart showing total entries per category.

### Page 3

Page 3 features 4 sections:

- Section 1: similar to previous pages, showing totals per subgroup with a corresponding donut chart;
- Section 2: a total for a variable with a table presenting percentages and totals, using color to highlight higher values;
- Section 3: a table divided into two parts for all values of this variable, showing percentages and totals;
- Section 4: a line chart with total entries per category.

### Page 4

Page 4 contains a single section with a table detailing the data previously presented. It also includes an additional filter to select one or multiple entries.

### Datasheet

The Datasheet, accessible only through the link provided in the footnote on previous pages, includes:

- Header: with the page title and a link to detailed information on the report;
- 4 sections: each providing a brief description of concepts present on each page;
- Footnote: featuring the company logo, a link to a form for user feedback on the report, and a link to return to the beginning.

## Further Notes

This was the first report I created for embedding on a company website for external users. It was highly motivating to have the opportunity to serve a broader and more diverse audience.

Additionally, it was my first time implementing dynamic row-level security. The solution I used was similar to the one shown in the image, which allowed using user logins to access respective data.
