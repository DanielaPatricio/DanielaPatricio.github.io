title: Project 1 - Quality of service

---


This project is about a report that was intended to be embedded on the company's website to provide information on quality of service, respectively, to each registered user. 

## The report

The final layout was a result of the cooperation between the team, on the layout itself, the clients on the visual that should be used, and which data should be presented, and my personal contribution on the visual formatting of the report. I've also created the data model for this report.

The report is composed by 5 pages and the colors used were the official ones, where the red is the company's main color, and the cyan is the color that the selected service. 

The interactions between the visuals where disabled allowing the users to have a clearer access to the insights. They can interact with the report by using the filters which are placed on the header and the filter pane.

### Page 1

![Page 1](/public/images/p1_1.png)

This page is composed by:

- Header: with the page title and the main filters (this layout is repeated through all pages except the Datasheet)
- Section 1: with the total and the totals per group and the correspondent donut chart (the donut chart as chosen instead the alternatives, a column chart and pie chart, because the data had 4 groups and it was more visually appealing to the established layout)
- Section 2: a gauge of the overall main KPI 
- Section 3: three heatmaps showing the main KPI per region
- Section 4: a line chart to show the trend of another KPI, using colors on the maximum and minimum values to ease the users'[preattentive processing](https://datascience.aero/brain-data-visualization/)
- Section 5: a stacked column chart with the totals per group and a line representing the KPI per date 
- Footnote: with company's logo, the timestamp of the last refresh, the dates being considered on the report and a link to the Datasheet

### Page 2

There are also 5 sections on this page:

- Section 1: similarly to the page 1, this section has the total and the totals, this time per subgroup, and the correspondent donut chart
- Section 2: with a total on a variable and a table presenting the percentage and total per each value. once again there was used color, this time a gradient, to appeal to the user's preattentive processing to the higher values.
- Section 3: table presenting, divided in two to present all values on this variable, the percentage and total per each value
- Section 4: a line chart to show the trend of another KPI, using colors on the maximum and minimum values
- Section 5: a line total per each category, although a bar chart was more adequate to the variable's type, this was the most appealing and simple chart

### Page 3

![Page 3](/public/images/p1_3.png)

The page 3 has 4 sections:

- Section 1: similarly to the previous pages, this section has the total and the totals, this time per subgroup, and the correspondent donut chart
- Section 2: with a total on a variable and a table presenting the percentage and total per each value using color to represent the higher values.
- Section 3: table presenting, divided in two to present all values on this variable, the percentage and total per each value
- Section 4: a line total per each category, this time was repeated choice to maintain the layout similar to the previous page and to not repeat the same type

### Page 4

![Page 4](/public/images/p1_4.png)

This page has only one section with a table detailing the data that was previously presented. There is also present an extra filter to select, one or multiple registers.

### Datasheet

![Datasheet](/public/images/p1_5.png)

The Datasheet, which is only accessible through the link present on the previous pages footnote link, has the following:

- Header: with the page title and link to the detailed information on the report
- 4 sections: each one having a small description of each concept present on each page.
- Footnote: with company's logo, a link to form where the users can provide suggestions on the report, and a link to return to the beginning


## Futher notes

This report was the first one that I've made with the goal of to be embedded on a company website to external users. It was really motivating to have the opportunity to serve a greater and more diverse audience.
Also, it was my first time using a dynamic role level security, the solution that Iâ€™ve used was one similar to the one represented on the image, which allowed to use the users' login to access the respective data.
