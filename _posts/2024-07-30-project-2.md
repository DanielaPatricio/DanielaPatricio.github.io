title: Project 2 - Net Promoter Score

---

This project was made with the goal of providing a report that shows the detailed information about the Net Promoter Score on a company's service. This report is accessed by users across the company and by the stakeholders.

## The report

The layout on this report and was made using the new template created to visually standartize the company's reports. I aided on the template creation and also made the data model for this report.

The report consists of 10 pages and the colors used were from the company's official color scheme.

Users can interact interact with the visuals by using the filters present on the pages and the filter pane. The interactions between visuals are enabled.


### Cover

## Further notes

This was a report that challenged me to reproduce the same information, through different scopes, while maintaining the visual appealling across the different pages. The main contributors for this were the usage of the most colors on the color scheme; and the usage of icons on the promoter/detractor information.
