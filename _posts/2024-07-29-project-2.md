title: Project 2 - Net Promoter Score
---

This project aimed to provide a report detailing the Net Promoter Score for a company's service. This report is accessed by users across the company and stakeholders.

## The Report

The layout of this report was created using the new template designed to visually standardize the company's reports. I contributed to the template creation and also developed the data model for this report.

The report consists of 10 pages, using the company's official color scheme.

Users can interact with the visuals using the filters on the pages and the filter pane. Interactions between visuals are enabled.

### Cover

## Further Notes

This report challenged me to reproduce the same information through different scopes while maintaining visual appeal across the different pages. The main contributors to this were the extensive use of the color scheme and the use of icons for promoter/detractor information.
