title: Project 3 - Using Power Automate to feed and refresh a Power BI dataset

---

This project had the goal of reporting daily information, based on events, on different situations that can affect the quality of service. 
The report is daily used across the company to act on those situations.
The main focus on this post is not the visuals but the ETL behind it.


## The Data Model

![Data Model](/public/images/datamodel.png)

The data model is quite complex. It is a star schema with 7 fact tables (each for a situation), 26 dimensions and 100+ columns and metrics.
All the facts tables are sourced by files present on sharepoint folders and the dimensions are the result of daily queries on azure databricks.

## Power Automate, the savior of the crown

The main challenge of this report was saving the daily information on each situation, without having a database and each query retriving from 1k to 170k rows, some running at night to be available at sunrise. 
Another fact that contributes to this challenge is the fact the Azure Databricks (SQL) allows scheduling on queries but not automatic extractions.

The temporary solution for this challenge was found on Power Automate, and it looks like this:

The blured image doesn't show much information but shows the complexity of the Power Automate flow, which is similar for each facts table.

The process has the following phases:
1. Automatically refreshes a Power BI semantic model, which runs the query on Azure Databricks SQL;
2. When the refresh is completed, the information is retrieved from the semantic model and saved in a csv file on sharepoint;
3. The file is saved, it refreshes, partially, the respective facts table on the report, which speeds up the refresh time and allows the information to be available earlier that a full refresh.

This process uses 4 connectors. 
One of them (the green one) is a custom connector, which was made to retrieve the result of the refreshes and to partially refresh a semantic model.
An Azure app was made to access the Power BI service api and to be used on the costum connector.

## Further notes

The solution applied on this case is temporary as there will be available a database to store this information. 
This project allowed me to add Power Automate to my skill set, which might be an easy way to automize tasks related to MS apps.
