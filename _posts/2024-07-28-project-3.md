title: Project 3 - Using Power Automate to feed and refresh a Power BI dataset

---

This project aimed to report daily information based on events regarding various situations that can affect the quality of service. 
The report is used daily across the company to address these situations. 
The main focus of this post is not the visuals but the ETL process behind it.


## The Data Model

<img src="/public/images/datamodel.png" alt="Data Model" width="600" height="400">

The data model is quite complex. It is a star schema with 7 fact tables (each for a situation), 26 dimensions and 100+ columns and metrics.
All the facts tables are sourced by files present on sharepoint folders and the dimensions are the result of daily queries on azure databricks.

## Power Automate: The Crown's Savior

The main challenge of this report was saving the daily information for each situation without having a database, while each query retrieves from 1k to 170k rows, some of which run overnight and should be available by morning. Another contributing factor to this challenge is that Azure Databricks (SQL) allows scheduling queries but not automatic extractions.

The temporary solution for this challenge was found in Power Automate, and it looks like this:

The blurred image doesn't show much detail but indicates the complexity of the Power Automate flow, which is similar for each fact table.

The process has the following phases:
1. Automatically refreshing a Power BI semantic model, which runs the query on Azure Databricks SQL;
2. Upon completion of the refresh, retrieving the information from the semantic model and saving it in a CSV file on SharePoint;
3. Once the file is saved, it refreshes, partially, the respective facts table on the report, which speeds up the refresh time and allows the information to be available earlier than a full refresh.

This process uses 4 connectors. 
One of them (the green one) is a custom connector, which was made to retrieve the result of the refreshes and to partially refresh a semantic model.
An Azure app was made to access the Power BI service api and to be used on the costum connector.

## Further notes

The solution applied in this case is temporary, as a database will eventually be available to store this information. 
This project allowed me to add Power Automate to my skill set, which might be an easy way to automate tasks related to Microsoft apps.
