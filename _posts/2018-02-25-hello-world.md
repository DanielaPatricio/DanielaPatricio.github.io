Hello World! I'm Daniela and in this post I intend to show a little bit about myself, my background and, most importantly, why I'm into Data Science and how this blog will help on my path to be a Data Scientist.

I was born 28 years ago in the beautiful city of [Setúbal](https://visitsetubal.com.pt/en/) and when I was a young child, my family moved to the sunny region of [Algarve](https://www.visitportugal.com/en/destinos/algarve) where I was raised. 

As I grew up in a region where the tourism is the main economic activity, I decided to enroll at the [University of Algarve](https://www.ualg.pt/en) to study the BSc. in Hospitality Management. There I acquired knowledge on the main concepts of Management, Strategy, Marketing and, of course, Tourism, which gave me a strong orientation for the quality of the service. 
Right after the BSc. completion I enrolled on the MSc. in Marketing, where I acquired knowledge in the areas of Communication and Marketing Research and deepen concepts on Management and Strategy. Before I started my dissertation, I had the opportunity to have my first professional challenge as intern on Organization and Quality. The main focus of the internship was the Quality Procedures, and the actives related to that purpose strengthened my organizational and professional skills.

After the internship I was able to focus on my dissertation, which allowed me to have my most significant opportunity, until then, to apply the scientific method and to work with data. The subject of my dissertation was the senior tourism in the Algarve region. The reason for the study was that Algarve, as touristic region, suffers a notorious seasonal effect that affects greatly the regional economy and the senior tourism, as a market segment, was, at the time of the study, the only one with a growing rate on the low season, meaning that it could be a solution to mitigate the seasonal effect. As I worked on the literature review, I found that one of the strategies to mitigate the touristic seasonality was to incentive the growing of demand at the mid-season, extending this way the high season. This approach lead me to narrow the subject of the dissertation to the study of the senior tourist in the mid-season in the Algarve. For this purpose, a questionnaire was made (in 3 different languages) and applied to a sample of tourists with the intend to gather information about their demographic characteristics, motivations to travel, travel planning, travel activities and their satisfaction with the activities and the region. This information was inserted into a database and from there the data was available to be analyzed. To perform this analysis, a dimensional reduction technique was applied, the Categorical Principal Component Analysis (CATPCA), which gave the input for the clustering technique to be applied, the K-Means. This all experience was really fulling for me, it impressed me greatly the fact that apparently random and complex social events can be translated and explained so clearly through analytic processes. 

With the dissertation I was really motivated to find professional challenge where I would be able to work with data, and the opportunity was given when I landed a job at EDP Distribuição. There I was allowed to develop activities the areas of Contract Management and Business Intelligence. In these areas I worked with data of the electrical distribution grid mainly on the Oracle Business Intelligence software. Through this platform I made, also assisted fellow colleagues on, data extraction and visualization by creating and managing dashboards, reports and queries. It was also given the opportunity to assist on the development of the Oracle platform for the EDP Distribuição where I learned about ETL processes and databases.

On my most recent professional experience I’ve worked as a Data Analysis Consultant at Nokia. The main responsibilities were related to developing and maintaining Dashboards and Reports, for ad-hoc and continuous needs, with Power BI. This tasks allowed me to grow my skills on data manipulation, data modelling and data visualization, DAX and Power Query M. I also proactively worked on identifying potential failures in data quality and presenting solutions to them.

On both companies, I had the opportunity to see that Data-Driven solutions have a huge impact on saving resources, optimizing processes and further improving profit. With the purpose to contribute to this domain, I’m working actively to acquire and improve the required skills to be a full Data Scientist. Actually, I’m developing a project based on web-scraping data and also joined on a Toastmasters club to improve communication and leadership skills. Furthermore, I read articles, make MOOCs and engage in the community, which is really welcoming and helpful. The main objective of this blog is to share the knowledge on what I learn a during this journey on the Data domain.
