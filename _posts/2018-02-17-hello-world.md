Hello World! I'm Daniela and in this post I intend to show a little bit about myself, my background and, most importantly, why I'm into Data Science and how this blog will do on my path to be a Data Scientist.

I was born 28 years ago in the beautiful city of [Setubal](https://visitsetubal.com.pt/en/) and when I was a young child, my family moved to the sunny region of [Algarve](https://www.visitportugal.com/en/destinos/algarve) where I was raised. 

As I grew up in a region where the tourism is the main economic activity, I decided to enroll at the [University of Algarve](https://www.ualg.pt/en) to study the BSc. in Hospitality Management. There I aquired knowledge on the main concepts of Managament, Strategy, Marketing and, of course, Tourism, which gave me a strong orientation to the quality of the service. 

Right after the BSc. completion I enrolled on the MSc. in Marketing, where I aquired knowledge in the areas of Communication and Marketing Research and deepen concepts on Management and Strategy. Before I started my dissertation, I had the oportunity to have my first professional challenge as intern in the Organization and Quality. The main focus of the intership was the Quality Procedures, and the activies related to that purpose strengthened my organizational and professional skills.

After the internship I was able to focus on my dissertion, which allowed me to have my most significant oportunity, until then, to apply the scientific method and to work with data.
