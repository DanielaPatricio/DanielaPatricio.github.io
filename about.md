## Here is an inspirational quote

“Graphical excellence is that which gives to the viewer the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest space.”
― Edward R. Tufte, The Visual Display of Quantitative Information, 2nd Ed.

## And some sugestions on Data Viz


[The Visual Display of Quantitative Information by Edward Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi)

This book is a must have for anyone who wants to learn how to achieve Graphical excellence. On of the main concepts introduced on the book is the data-ink ratio, where the ratio is higher the greatest the quantity of data is represented by each pixel of ink.

A deep dive on the Data Visualization theory. This book shows how the human brain perceives and processes information visually and how to use this to produce higher quality visuals.

[Data to Viz by Yan Holz](https://www.data-to-viz.com)

A page with an interactive decision tree to choose the right visual according to the type of that. It is also available the history of the visual and the code for it in R, Python and D3.js.
