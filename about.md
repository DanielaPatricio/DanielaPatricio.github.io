I am an Aspiring Data Scientist with professional experience in Business Intelligence, Information Management, Contract Management and Quality Procedures.

During the execution of my dissertation for the MSc. in Marketing, I was allowed to work with a variety of data processes as data’s collection, cleaning, analysis and visualization. This experience open up a world where I found my passion for data. This passion lead me to my last professional challenge, at EDP Distribuição, where I had the opportunity to work on Business Intelligence related to energy distribution data. 
At the moment I continue to pursue data-driven challenges with the purpose of growing my strengths into the Data Science domain.

As for personal traits, I consider myself a natural team-player,curious-thinker, flexible, problem solver and a dedicated person who is eager to learn. 

The main areas of my interests, besides Data Science, are Culture, Energy, Health, Technology, Travelling, Science and Sports. 
Actually I spend my free time on exercising, watching TV series, playing video games and going to concerts.
